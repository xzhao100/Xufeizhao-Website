        <p class="lead mb-4">As a first-generation immigrant, I struggled with self-acceptance and embracing my cultural identity. It was hard finding a balance between the culture that I was born into and the one that I was learning to adapt to. I would be teased for being ‚Äútoo Asian‚Äù, liking Chinese films and Korean music, and bringing rice and dinner leftovers for lunch.

I thought Asian Americans would be understanding since we shared the same cultural background, but that optimism was shattered when most of the judgment came from them. This exacerbated my struggle with self-acceptance. I started to live in fear of how others would perceive me. I developed resentment towards my own culture and masked my interests. It worsened to the point where I avoided speaking Taishanese in public. My mom‚Äôs disappointment after I declined her phone call led me to reevaluate my decisions. 

My guilt for denying my authenticity became so evident that I could no longer ignore it. I thought to myself, ‚ÄúI should be proud of my identity.‚Äù The initial step I took to challenge my perspective was by surrounding myself with positive people and befriending those who are not ashamed of my authentic self. My friend that plays football propelled my development significantly. He was dedicated to and took pride in his sport despite being a part of an underdog team. His spirit taught me to fully embrace my authenticity. From that, I‚Äôve learned that my identity can only be created by myself and not by other‚Äôs perceptions of me. 

Learning to be comfortable with expressing my culture had a surprising impact on my academics. I was able to empathize with the characters I read about, which allowed me to develop a strong understanding of the narrative. This allowed me to excel in English classes. I wrote strong analyses of the content we read and did well on essays. That later sparked my interest in pursuing social sciences in college. I want to learn how to provide support to others when they are coping with changes and cultural adaptation.
<br><br>

        The summer before my Sophomore year, I stepped out of my comfort zone and joined Community Youth Center‚Äôs Dragon Boat team. When I was offered the chance to join, I debated whether I should or not. I wasn‚Äôt a physically active person. I‚Äôve never participated in sports prior to this opportunity. However, I ended up joining in hopes of getting in shape and being part of a community.

I went through Freshman year of high school feeling very lonely since most of my friends went to other schools. I was unable to find a place where I felt like I belonged until I joined Dragon Boat. It was through my team that I finally found the warmth and sense of belonging I was looking for. Besides obtaining my initial goal of being physically active, my team played an important role in helping me redefine my perception of self-worth.

          My upbringing contributed to my belief that in order to be praised and loved by others, I had to be the best. Performance-based acceptance has been ingrained in my head. I used to get frustrated if I didn‚Äôt excel in school. I ached for my family‚Äôs validation that I would only receive if I did well academically. However, being on this team helped me experience a different reality. The encouragement I received from my teammates during our most intense workouts was something that I was unable to experience at home with my parents. I valued support through the process instead of just affirmation based on the outcome. 

  The confidence I gained from my teammate‚Äôs encouragement motivated me to strive for excellence in other aspects of life, like school. Instead of dwelling on how I would respond to my parents‚Äô critiques, I persisted whenever I hit a low point during the semester, remembering that my value was based on integrity during the process instead of outcomes. I‚Äôll adopt the same mentality if I encounter unforeseen circumstances in the future. Although I‚Äôve taken many advanced level courses, what I‚Äôve learned about my worth and abilities through Dragon Boat has better prepared me for college.<br><br>

        I first learned that my school offers Environmental Science after a former student recommended it to me. I considered his words and signed up for that class. Before, I thought environmental science was just compost, recycling and ‚Äúsaying no to plastics‚Äù. We watched a documentary in class about overfishing and how a group of environmentalists attempted to resolve the problem. I thought they were being overambitious since it requires a tremendous amount of effort to solve overfishing. After the documentary, my teacher told us, ‚Äúno matter how little you think your effort is, don‚Äôt feel discouraged and don‚Äôt be afraid to take action.‚Äù

This approach impacted how I tackled my personal challenges and how I cared for the environment. During my Junior year of high school, I hit rock bottom. My grades were dropping and my mental health followed. I felt disoriented and lost, not knowing what I was trying to achieve in life. My teacher‚Äôs encouragement after that documentary inspired me to take things one step at a time instead of all at once. This gave me the motivation that I lacked to begin repairing my grades through summer and online classes. I told myself, although it can be hard to see results immediately, consistent effort, even if small, can lead to improvement.

I exercised that same mindset in my care for the environment. I also referred students to take that course hoping that they can develop the same concern for the environment. Compared to before, I conduct more research on relevant environmental issues online. This inspired my recent proposal to my peers for our mission trip with Cameron House Friday Night Club. We planned to give back to the community by dedicating our trip‚Äôs focus on restoring the environment and alleviating ecological issues. Although we have not gone on the trip, we have been devoting our Friday nights to researching locations that need our help. Through my hard work, I aim to influence others to take action in taking care of our Earth as well.
